    Last year, I stayed at the Hilton New York Times Square. I loved the spacious guest rooms and its location just a short walk from Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Bryant Park, NY Public Library, Empire State Building, Junior's Deli, Carmine's, Sardi's and many other restaurants...and of course,  everything in and around Times Square - all within a few minutes from the hotel. There's no need to take an expensive taxi or Uber - just walk out the front door and each of these attractions (and many more) are close by. Headed to the 9/11 Memorial or any other place in lower Manhattan?  They can be reached in less than 30 minutes courtesy of a subway line located just outside the hotel’s front entrance. 
    Based on last years’ experience, I booked the Hilton for this year’s stay. I was shocked upon arrival to view the hotel’s $20 million renovation that included an entirely transformed ground floor lobby, 15th floor Sky Lobby, and three brand new food and beverage options.
   Note: I especially love the fact that guests must pass by the doormen stationed around-the-clock in the ground floor lobby, then take an elevator 15 floors to reach the main, or newly-renovated Sky Lobby. In my opinion, this layout offers the upmost in safety and security for those concerned about visiting a large city. 
   Drawing inspiration from New York’s Gilded Age, the Sky Lobby is a spacious, calming oasis from the city’s noise and activity, outfitted with luxurious, yet comfortable furnishings and a beautiful collection of artwork. Also located on the 15th floor is High Rise, a dining option I enjoyed each morning that offers an indulgent buffet-style brunch in a calm, relaxed setting.
    To fuel up for a long day of walking, I chose from among an impressive selection of traditional breakfast and brunch offerings, including freshly-baked pastries, waffles and breads, fresh fruits, meats, cereals and oatmeal with toppings, fresh juices and coffee. Next door, the Long Acre Market offers fresh coffee and cold beverages, artisanal sandwiches and many other ""to-go"" items (as well as an assortment of gifts) for quick meals and snacks. 
   Guest rooms at the 44-story-high hotel are some of the LARGEST standard rooms in Times Square, an important feature that transforms any stay. Rooms, especially those starting on the 22nd floor, offer sweeping views of New York’s famed skyline, Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the Hudson River.

i have booked 6 months before my stay throught an agency a deluxe room with 2 queen beds high floor.","Terrible experience for us...
I have booked 6 months before my stay throught an agency a Deluxe room with 2 queen beds high floor. It was only for 1 night with my husband and my 2 kids.
We checked-in very late in the evening (around 11pm) and what was my surprise when they gave us the Aladdin room with 1 bed + a sofa (not made as a bed). I went back to the front desk and I was told that ""as you made the reservation through a third-party (an agency), we can't guarranty the room""... But WHAT ?? I have paid extra to be on high floor!! So they could give me a room with 2 twin beds but low floor with a smell of humidity and a hand-written note for another guest who changed his room I suppose...
They treated us very badly, no respect and I certainly won't recommand this hotel to anyone. They are tons of hotels in NY, don't bother to go there...",2025-04-24,New York City,NY,United States

The complimentary buffet breakfast was impressive, offering a wide range of options. Special mention to General Manager Thomas Caska, who provided exceptional service.

7,"Avoid!! Long lines, unfriendly staff, dirty rooms",1,service,positive,"chose hilton based on the “brand.“ we paid a premium compared to other hotels in the area at almost $600 a night, but justified the extra cost assuming we could expect excellent service and accommodations from hilton.","Really disappointing stay. Kids were on spring break so decided on a family NYC trip (couple and 2 children, 8 and 10). Chose Hilton based on the “brand.“ We paid a premium compared to other hotels in the area at almost $600 a night, but justified the extra cost assuming we could expect excellent service and accommodations from Hilton. It was anything but.

First, accessing your room is a huge hassle. You enter on the ground floor where you have to take an elevator to the “lobby.” There are only two (very slow) elevators available from the ground floor to the lobby, and one was consistently out of service our entire stay, so you have to wait in line (in one case for 10 minutes) just to get to the lobby, where you then take a second elevator to your room. Same thing when you leave—long lines in the lobby to crowd into the one functioning elevator just to get to the street. 

On top of that, they weren’t at all apologetic or friendly about the elevator situation. Instead, one of the employees working the ground floor stands next to the elevator shouting and scolding guests to “be patient, you need to wait your turn, don’t get in people’s way” while you’re waiting. Even if you’re just standing there, not being impatient or in people’s way. At one point he snapped at my 8 year old son for standing in front of the elevator doors (as people normally do) instead of off to the side while we waited. Great way to be welcomed to our overpriced hotel after a long day walking around the city.

Check-in took forever because they only had two employees working long lines, one of whom spent most of the time staring at a computer helping no one. The woman who checked us in was clearly tired and stressed. Literally did not smile once and sped through the check in details. Not that I blame her, it was a madhouse. Which was the state of the lobby during our entire stay. Any questions for the front desk at any time? Expect to wait in a long line in a hot and crowded lobby, only to get a disinterested response. Need to call the front desk? Expect to be placed on hold for a few minutes and hung up on. Oh, and while lined up at the front desk? Expect to battle for space with the long elevator line and vice versa.

The only positive about the room was the view. And shower pressure was fine. Otherwise, the bathroom was outdated and the mirror was cracked.  There was dust all over the vents and surfaces, water  stains on the lamp shades and mystery dried sticky substances (white and dark) on various surfaces, including the mirror, bedside tables, and lamps. Basic cable tv with no apps, no interactive guide, or on demand movies. We were near the elevators and heard every time an elevator passed, at all hours. Mini fridge made a high pitched noise that sounded almost like fire alarm going off in another room  (took us a while to figure out the source). We tried to call the front desk about it but couldn’t get through and just didn’t have the energy to wait in line.

Ordered room service once, which was overpriced, packaged like fast food, and hastily dropped off. No cart, tray, plates, or real utensil, just a guy dropping off a paper bag of food. My $25 burger (without fries) was fine, but comparable to Applebees. No chicken tenders or kids options, so that sucked. Four ketchup packets for three sandwiches and two orders of fries, so my wife had to go chase down more. Oh and the breakfast buffet is $50 a person which is just outrageous, so never tried it. I did grab coffee at the cafe one morning. Cost was $9.50 a cup for mediocre coffee (plus the guy who rang us up telling us to pick a tip option while he stares at the screen). We chose to battle the elevator line and get better coffee at the actual coffee shop next door for less than half the price the rest of the trip.

Location is fine, but we were further than expected from the attractions that interested us and the streets around the hotel are very crowded. Overall you are in Times Square though.

Cherry on top of it all was when we were leaving, one of the ground floor guys practically chased us down and strong armed us into having him hail us a taxi (obviously for the tip). But then he started chatting with someone outside and completely forget about us. We stood there for about 10 minutes on a cold sidewalk with our bags and tired kids, and watched several taxis go by before I finally ask him if we should just get our own taxi. He looks at me puzzled and asks, “you need a taxi? Oh yeah...” 

Pretty much summed up the hotel experience. Almost $600 a night to be treated like an afterthought and a nuisance. Trip was great otherwise, but I will never stay here again and I am completely turned off the Hilton brand. I have had much better stays at much cheaper hotels.",2025-04-17,New York City,NY,United States

Instead, one of the employees working the ground floor stands next to the elevator shouting and scolding guests to “be patient, you need to wait your turn, don’t get in people’s way” while you’re waiting. Even if you’re just standing there, not being impatient or in people’s way. At one point he snapped at my 8 year old son for standing in front of the elevator doors (as people normally do) instead of off to the side while we waited. Great way to be welcomed to our overpriced hotel after a long day walking around the city.

Check-in took forever because they only had two employees working long lines, one of whom spent most of the time staring at a computer helping no one. The woman who checked us in was clearly tired and stressed. Literally did not smile once and sped through the check in details. Not that I blame her, it was a madhouse. Which was the state of the lobby during our entire stay. Any questions for the front desk at any time? Expect to wait in a long line in a hot and crowded lobby, only to get a disinterested response. Need to call the front desk? Expect to be placed on hold for a few minutes and hung up on. Oh, and while lined up at the front desk? Expect to battle for space with the long elevator line and vice versa.

The only positive about the room was the view. And shower pressure was fine. Otherwise, the bathroom was outdated and the mirror was cracked.  There was dust all over the vents and surfaces, water  stains on the lamp shades and mystery dried sticky substances (white and dark) on various surfaces, including the mirror, bedside tables, and lamps. Basic cable tv with no apps, no interactive guide, or on demand movies. We were near the elevators and heard every time an elevator passed, at all hours. Mini fridge made a high pitched noise that sounded almost like fire alarm going off in another room  (took us a while to figure out the source). We tried to call the front desk about it but couldn’t get through and just didn’t have the energy to wait in line.

Ordered room service once, which was overpriced, packaged like fast food, and hastily dropped off. No cart, tray, plates, or real utensil, just a guy dropping off a paper bag of food. My $25 burger (without fries) was fine, but comparable to Applebees. No chicken tenders or kids options, so that sucked. Four ketchup packets for three sandwiches and two orders of fries, so my wife had to go chase down more. Oh and the breakfast buffet is $50 a person which is just outrageous, so never tried it. I did grab coffee at the cafe one morning. Cost was $9.50 a cup for mediocre coffee (plus the guy who rang us up telling us to pick a tip option while he stares at the screen). We chose to battle the elevator line and get better coffee at the actual coffee shop next door for less than half the price the rest of the trip.

Location is fine, but we were further than expected from the attractions that interested us and the streets around the hotel are very crowded. Overall you are in Times Square though.

Cherry on top of it all was when we were leaving, one of the ground floor guys practically chased us down and strong armed us into having him hail us a taxi (obviously for the tip). But then he started chatting with someone outside and completely forget about us. We stood there for about 10 minutes on a cold sidewalk with our bags and tired kids, and watched several taxis go by before I finally ask him if we should just get our own taxi. He looks at me puzzled and asks, “you need a taxi? Oh yeah...” 

Pretty much summed up the hotel experience. Almost $600 a night to be treated like an afterthought and a nuisance. Trip was great otherwise, but I will never stay here again and I am completely turned off the Hilton brand. I have had much better stays at much cheaper hotels.",2025-04-17,New York City,NY,United States
7,"Avoid!! Long lines, unfriendly staff, dirty rooms",1,food,negative,"ordered room service once, which was overpriced, packaged like fast food, and hastily dropped off.","Really disappointing stay. Kids were on spring break so decided on a family NYC trip (couple and 2 children, 8 and 10). Chose Hilton based on the “brand.“ We paid a premium compared to other hotels in the area at almost $600 a night, but justified the extra cost assuming we could expect excellent service and accommodations from Hilton. It was anything but.

First, accessing your room is a huge hassle. You enter on the ground floor where you have to take an elevator to the “lobby.” There are only two (very slow) elevators available from the ground floor to the lobby, and one was consistently out of service our entire stay, so you have to wait in line (in one case for 10 minutes) just to get to the lobby, where you then take a second elevator to your room. Same thing when you leave—long lines in the lobby to crowd into the one functioning elevator just to get to the street.

The location is absolutely unbeatable, right in the heart of Times Square.

First off, the moment you walk in, you're greeted by very friendly doormen who quickly recognised us every time we walk past and then by the beautiful smell of the lobby, which we couldn’t help but compliment every time we passed through. The lobby leads up to the Sky Lobby, which immediately gives you a sense of safety and security. We arrived at check-in around 1pm, and although our room was ready, they offered early check-in for a $50 fee or we could wait until 4pm. After a long international flight, we decided to pay the $50 to get into the room early.

The check-in process was smooth—we showed our passports to confirm the booking and were asked for a $100 per night incidental hold fee. We were charged $500 on the card as a holding fee. The receptionist also explained that we'd be charged hotel tax ($35+tax), but we would receive a $35 daily credit to use in the hotel (this doesn’t roll over to the next day). It’s easy to use at places like the bar or Long Acre Market, which is located on the same floor as the lobby. This is easily used as we found the market to be really expensive, e.g $5.50 for a bottle of Coke/Fanta. 

We stayed on the 33rd floor, room 3318, and the views were just amazing. To the right, you can see Times Square, to the left, the Hudson River, and below, you get a great view of 42nd Street. The room itself was incredibly spacious and clean, with everything we needed—iron, hairdryer, safe, and more. The only minor downside was that our room was adjoining the room next door, but if that's the only issue in a five-night stay, they’re definitely doing something right.

Every single staff member we interacted with was friendly and welcoming, and we appreciated the chats with them.

Checking out was just as easy as checking in. We got the balance refunded from the $500 deposit, and after five days of hotel fees and taxes, I received $256 back on my card within two days. Our flight wasn’t until later in the evening, so we paid $5 each to have our luggage stored with the doormen for the day.

As for the location—wow, we were literally in the center of everything. The subway line is right outside the hotel’s front door, making it easy to get anywhere (uptown, downtown, or even Brooklyn). Times Square is just five minutes away, and other landmarks like Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Bryant Park, the NY Public Library, and the Empire State Building are all within a short walk.

I can’t wait to be back and will definitely be choosing this hotel again for my next stay!",2025-04-08,New York City,NY,United States

The check-in process was smooth—we showed our passports to confirm the booking and were asked for a $100 per night incidental hold fee. We were charged $500 on the card as a holding fee. The receptionist also explained that we'd be charged hotel tax ($35+tax), but we would receive a $35 daily credit to use in the hotel (this doesn’t roll over to the next day). It’s easy to use at places like the bar or Long Acre Market, which is located on the same floor as the lobby. This is easily used as we found the market to be really expensive, e.g $5.50 for a bottle of Coke/Fanta. 

We stayed on the 33rd floor, room 3318, and the views were just amazing. To the right, you can see Times Square, to the left, the Hudson River, and below, you get a great view of 42nd Street. The room itself was incredibly spacious and clean, with everything we needed—iron, hairdryer, safe, and more. The only minor downside was that our room was adjoining the room next door, but if that's the only issue in a five-night stay, they’re definitely doing something right.

Every single staff member we interacted with was friendly and welcoming, and we appreciated the chats with them.

Checking out was just as easy as checking in. We got the balance refunded from the $500 deposit, and after five days of hotel fees and taxes, I received $256 back on my card within two days. Our flight wasn’t until later in the evening, so we paid $5 each to have our luggage stored with the doormen for the day.

As for the location—wow, we were literally in the center of everything. The subway line is right outside the hotel’s front door, making it easy to get anywhere (uptown, downtown, or even Brooklyn). Times Square is just five minutes away, and other landmarks like Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Bryant Park, the NY Public Library, and the Empire State Building are all within a short walk.

I can’t wait to be back and will definitely be choosing this hotel again for my next stay!",2025-04-08,New York City,NY,United States

A special shoutout to the front desk staff—everyone was so kind and helpful. With the city being so hectic and us feeling a bit overwhelmed at times, they went out of their way to make things easier for us, whether it was giving directions or answering questions with patience and a smile.

The food at the hotel restaurant was fresh and delicious, especially breakfast, which had plenty of options to start the day right.

24,Staying at hotels 1/2 the year and I will never come back,1,cleanliness,positive,clean the vents to the furnace once in a while!,"Do not expect anything back for burning your Hilton Honors points to stay here if you are a Diamond member. . Did a weekend thing with my wife to New York. We got our H2O upon check in which is all you will get for the weekend. 

Their Market place charges 1 Ltr of water $15and  a 20oz at $10. Even Costco in NY doesn’t charge that much by the case nor 48 pack. Incidentally,  would not be surprised if they got their water from them. 

Rooms are desperately needed of remodeling and do not match the picture in the rooms. Carpet is worn, paint is chip, furniture  been there since the 70’s etc. this is on the top floor too.  Clean the vents to the furnace once in a while! 

Not impressed with check-in attitudes as the rest of the staff is professional and accommodating. Front desk has the attitude probably because they get the complaints of everything I am writing in here.

There is two entrances to the hotel and (the back?) the 41st street looks like you are entering a secret door with a small Hilton sign and construction scaffolding hiding it. Since Pot is legal in NY they smoke it everywhere including outside the doors. 

At 350-400 /night it makes you wonder if they are charging that much to keep up with the rest hotels in Manhatten or just trying to keep the lights on if the bulb even works. 

Just another Hilton property swirling the toilet bowl. Spend the extra money and stay away from here.",2025-03-09,New York City,NY,United States
28,Still the best Hilton chain hotel in Manhattan,5,food,positive,the takeaway and shop has a pretty good collection of items you can grab for a  cheaper breakfast or meal and to use your hhonors f & b credit in if you don’t want to pay for the full buffet which was definitely pricey (american hotel buffets aren’t really of the same calibre as in asia or internationally and are on the basic side so probably not worth usd $50 plus taxes and tips).,"I just spent an extended stay in Manhattan and stayed in many different Hilton hotels in various locations and brands and the Hilton Times Square was still my favourite. It was also my favourite in a previous extended stay in different Hilton hotels in Manhattan 12 years ago.

The rooms at this property are very spacious by Manhattan standards, and all rooms on either side or on whichever floor all have great views, so the rooms are very comfortable and pleasing here. I stayed here twice and tried both sides of the hotel and has really unobstructed Manhattan skyline views, though I personally preferred the Empire State / Downtown outlook.

The new sky lobby floor with new bar, restaurant, reception, takeaway and shop is fantastic and beautifully designed. The takeaway and shop has a pretty good collection of items you can grab for a  cheaper breakfast or meal and to use your HHonors F & B credit in if you don’t want to pay for the full buffet which was definitely pricey (American hotel buffets aren’t really of the same calibre as in Asia or internationally and are on the basic side so probably not worth USD $50 plus taxes and tips). Sure, the lobby shop prices were tourist prices but it was very convenient and nice to be able to pop down from your room to grab something.

The location is perfect. Very close to all the madness of Times Square, but also off the side enough you can avoid that if you want to. There are so many great dining options in Hell’s Kitchen which is very close by, so that was a big plus for me. Love the Westway Diner for breakfast and any other meals – great value and lots of fresh and healthy food options. You can also find good reasonably priced wash, dry, & fold laundry services and dry cleaners in Hell’s Kitchen too. 42nd St Times Square subway stops will connect you to pretty much anywhere in metro NYC so super convenient.

The Hilton New York Times Square is a service focused hotel, and I found all the staff to be great, front desk, housekeeping, bar staff etc. I like the 41st Street entrance too as it makes it easy to pull-up in a car and you can avoid the gridlock on 42nd Street.

I liked this hotel more than the Tempo Times Square as the rooms were bigger, had much better views, and the lobby/bar/restaurant/shop was a lot nicer. The Tempo is a massive hotel but the lobby was quite small, so it was really zoo like and crazy all the time. The Hilton Times Square was a lot calmer and easier to navigate. Unlike the Tempo there was no annoying urban resort fee either! Sure, the hotel and services aren’t cheap, but it is a wonderful hotel and definitely my favourite after trying so many different Hilton chain hotels in Manhattan as a Diamond guest on both this and my previous trip.",2025-03-04,New York City,NY,United States

28,Still the best Hilton chain hotel in Manhattan,5,food,positive,love the westway diner for breakfast and any other meals – great value and lots of fresh and healthy food options.,"I just spent an extended stay in Manhattan and stayed in many different Hilton hotels in various locations and brands and the Hilton Times Square was still my favourite. It was also my favourite in a previous extended stay in different Hilton hotels in Manhattan 12 years ago.

The rooms at this property are very spacious by Manhattan standards, and all rooms on either side or on whichever floor all have great views, so the rooms are very comfortable and pleasing here. I stayed here twice and tried both sides of the hotel and has really unobstructed Manhattan skyline views, though I personally preferred the Empire State / Downtown outlook.

The new sky lobby floor with new bar, restaurant, reception, takeaway and shop is fantastic and beautifully designed. The takeaway and shop has a pretty good collection of items you can grab for a  cheaper breakfast or meal and to use your HHonors F & B credit in if you don’t want to pay for the full buffet which was definitely pricey (American hotel buffets aren’t really of the same calibre as in Asia or internationally and are on the basic side so probably not worth USD $50 plus taxes and tips). Sure, the lobby shop prices were tourist prices but it was very convenient and nice to be able to pop down from your room to grab something.

The location is perfect. Very close to all the madness of Times Square, but also off the side enough you can avoid that if you want to. There are so many great dining options in Hell’s Kitchen which is very close by, so that was a big plus for me. Love the Westway Diner for breakfast and any other meals – great value and lots of fresh and healthy food options. You can also find good reasonably priced wash, dry, & fold laundry services and dry cleaners in Hell’s Kitchen too. 42nd St Times Square subway stops will connect you to pretty much anywhere in metro NYC so super convenient.

The Hilton New York Times Square is a service focused hotel, and I found all the staff to be great, front desk, housekeeping, bar staff etc. I like the 41st Street entrance too as it makes it easy to pull-up in a car and you can avoid the gridlock on 42nd Street.

The hotel is ideally situated with plenty attractions, places to eat and subways near by.  The hotel itself has an impressive lobby and bar/restaurant area.  Upon arrival the staff were welcoming and very friendly.  The room itself was clean but a little tired in areas. The curtains were scuffed at the bottom and the desk chair had a small rip in it.  One of the drapes had a small tear in it but the other had been removed and not replaced.  The hand moisturiser in the bathroom was also hanging off the wall.  Overall I was happy with the hotel due to its location and the view from our room.  I would stay here again as the hotel had an ideal location, but think it does need a bit more care, especially as you associate the Hilton brand with high expectations.  Eating and drinking in the hotel is expensive, even though you get $35 room credit, a couple of drinks soon disappears.",2025-02-26,New York City,NY,United States

The only downfall is they con you with the taxi charges DO NOT BOOK A TAXI THROUGH THE HOTEL they booked a taxi for me told me it was 110 dollars to jfk I was then charged 20 dollars on my card for them picking up the phone to book and the driver charged me 130 dollars was annoyed to say the least plenty yellow cabs that are all metered and don’t rip you off.

Joes pizza is a 5 minute walk best pizza I’ve ever had. We also went to an Italian called Tony’s Di Napoli amazing staff and the steak and pasta were
To die for.

If I had any recommendations to make to this hotel I would say the following: 
If a room is booked for 3 people don’t charge for an additional bed to be put in the room, and if you want people to eat breakfast in the hotel then your prices need to be competitive with the going breakfast rates in diners.

The room was fabulous (could do with updating, like the rest of the hotel has been) however it was spotlessly clean, which in my opinion is the most important thing in any hotel! The bed was so comfy & pillows where amazing, we slept so well. We also had no outside noise at night which was very strange for a New York hotel (maybe our room was above a very quiet area!) and finally the size of the room was unbelievable for New York, it was like the size of a Vegas hotel room! I know people say it does not matter the size of the room as you are only in it to sleep, but this was definitely a benefit. Me and my friend where able to lie both our suitcases fully open on the floor and this did not effect walking around the room, or getting to the bed or bathroom. This was a excellent hotel and value for money booked with BA holidays (which cannot be beaten on package prices) would definitely stay here again.",2025-02-08,New York City,NY,United States

44,What a Wonderful Stay,5,service,positive,he provided nothing short but amazing service!,"We had such a wonderful stay at the Hilton NY Times Square.  Let me first start by recognizing Mike from the Bell Staff.  He provided nothing short but amazing service!  It all started with us checking in.  I had my rental car and prepared to park off site.  I was hesitant about how we were going to be able to drop our luggage and check in.  I proceeded to 41st entrance, where Mike was out on the street directing traffic and helping with valet.  He immediately saw me pull up and assisted by taking our luggage, and helped with temporary parking my vehicle while we checked in.  For our checkout process, it was so smooth, and when I left the facility to go pick up my vehicle, Mike saw me pulling up, and helped parked my vehicle while I went in to grab my luggage.  He then helped load everything up and provided easy directions back to the Lincoln Tunnel.

About the hotel stay.  What an amazing view from the 37 floor.  They even provided us with a better room and view since we checked in early and our previous room wasn't ready.  I wasn't expected that at all, however the front desk agent was also wonderful and very pleasant.  Im sorry I couldn't recall her name, but if you remember who you were, kudos for your service.

We were right in the heart of Times Square, so easy access to everything.  We will definitely be back!  Well Done Hilton.",2025-01-29,New York City,NY,United States

This left one of our children sleeping on the floor, which was far from acceptable. The other child had to sleep in a tent-bed, which was far away from what we needed. To make matters worse, there was no apology from the staff, and they blamed the issue on the travel agency. Later on they came with a roomservice with a cake and said happy birthday, but no one was celebrating anything. We tried several times to change our room but they were still blaming the travel agency. 

During check-out, no one even bothered to ask how our stay had been. This lack of accountability and customer service was very disappointing and not what we expected from a Hilton property. We would not recommend staying here if you are more then 2 people.

Also I did not bring this up but if you had read my booking information correctly, you would of found out that I had paid for a 2 queen beds deluxe high floor which the 24th floor is only 3 floors up reception.

Now to the bar, I do like a little night cap before bed but having paid £16 for a 330ml bottle of larger and a coke that was full to brim with ice and that they could hardly fit any coke in lets just say it only happened the once. 

Now if you don't know your city tax or resort fee is $100 a night which you get $35 back to spend, so having teenagers with me we use to get snacks from the mini market not the cheapest but as I did not exchange cash it was like it was free. The thing is when I pick the stuff up off the shelves place them next to the till and the person working behind the till as to ring it up, now when that person turn's a machine to me and says please add tip, I feel you are having a laugh and that I did more work than you did.

The same goes to the gents who look after the luggage when you are leaving asking have you tipped, I don't mind tipping and I do tip but I do not like to be asked to tip you before you have even touched my case or I have even paid to store my cases.

79,Serious Security and Hygiene Issues ! A Complete Disappointment!,1,cleanliness,negative,"first, dirty water was coming back up from the bathtub, which is an absolute scandal in terms of hygiene.","Our experience at this hotel was nothing short of a disaster. First, dirty water was coming back up from the bathtub, which is an absolute scandal in terms of hygiene. It’s unbelievable that such a fundamental issue could be ignored by the hotel management. To make matters worse, the staff were indifferent and completely failed to provide any solutions, further escalating the problem.

Additionally, we were given a connecting room, and the person in the adjacent room attempted to open the connecting door during the night. This is completely unacceptable in terms of security and privacy. The hotel’s failure to take precautions against such risks is a clear act of negligence.

Staying at a place that fails so miserably in both hygiene and security puts your health and peace of mind at serious risk. I strongly advise against staying at this hotel. It’s nothing but a waste of your time and money!",2024-12-05,New York City,NY,United States

88,Enjoyable and comfortable,4,cleanliness,positive,the hotel was clean and beautifully decorated for the holiday season.,"I took my daughter on a trip to the city fir her 21st birthday. The hotel was clean and beautifully decorated for the holiday season. The staff were kind and helpful at all times. Of course there is a lot of noise and lights, but it's Times Square! We were on the 40th floor and the view was wonderful! The blackout curtains were plenty to block the light.  There's only 3 things I wasn't a fan of, and that's why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  

1- our bathroom door was a sliding door without a lock, which is just weird. 
2- there were no extra blankets available without calling the desk.   I'm sure they would have absolutely brought one, but it was late and I was too tired to care that much. But I've never been to a hotel that didn't have just one extra blanket in the closet. 
3- their buffet prices are high. I get it, it's NYC but around 35 for a continental breakfast was a lot

I would likely book here again, or at another Hilton.  At the end of the day, the cons were minor inconveniences and the cleanliness of the hotel along with the professional and kind staff far outweighed it.",2024-11-25,New York City,NY,United States

88,Enjoyable and comfortable,4,amenities,positive,we were on the 40th floor and the view was wonderful!,"I took my daughter on a trip to the city fir her 21st birthday. The hotel was clean and beautifully decorated for the holiday season. The staff were kind and helpful at all times. Of course there is a lot of noise and lights, but it's Times Square! We were on the 40th floor and the view was wonderful! The blackout curtains were plenty to block the light.  There's only 3 things I wasn't a fan of, and that's why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  

1- our bathroom door was a sliding door without a lock, which is just weird. 
2- there were no extra blankets available without calling the desk.   I'm sure they would have absolutely brought one, but it was late and I was too tired to care that much. But I've never been to a hotel that didn't have just one extra blanket in the closet.

Visited NYC for my 30th with my partner. was apprehensive after reading reviews about construction within the hotel. The reviews couldn't be more wrong. The construction was minimal and only on week days, it didn't bother us at all!
We arrived and was shown to the lift to the reception area, checked in promptly and couldn't of been easier or more helpful. There is a shop within the hotel, its very pricey. But if you are eligible for the $35 daily its a good way to spend it. The rooms were immaculate and cleaned daily. AC in the room was fab! Lots of amenities, shower gel, shampoo. Gym on site was lovely. The location of this hotel is brilliant, right on times square.

I’ll start with the pro’s ! The pro’s where the room was clean, location was super and view was breathtaking (that’s if you like heights) I don’t do that was a con really for me.
Let’s get to the con’s. On arrival after a 7 hour flight from the UK and 1 hours train journey you’d think you’d be greeted by a warm welcoming smile but no !! Rude obnoxious staff welcomed you. The luggage men are so pushy and will not take no for an answer as they just want a tip. When checking in the man on reception spoke that fast I didn’t understand half the information he was telling me ! Then he advised me to put my card in whilst he took $400 for a deposit ! This put a proper dampener on the holiday as that took half my spends when I wasn’t informed ! That night we went to bed and did not get an ounce of sleep ! You could hear the whole floor levels chains from the toilet flushing and children were running across the upstairs rooms from 2am till 6am. You could also hear all the emergency services sirens all night. The next day I got up with no sleep and went down for breakfast ! €60 for a Buffett style breakfast are  you joking me ?? The hotel has a market which sells breakfast which is ridiculously overpriced ! I know it’s NYC but €42 for two croissants and 2 bottles of juice I kid you not. The man at the cashier served us with a super rude approach. He asked me if I would like the bill adding to my room which I replied yes too. He informed me three times than it hadn’t worked and I must not of had a card on file which I did. Three attempts back and fourth to do it also feeling humiliated and embarrassed the way he spoke to me infront of other customers then had the cheek to ask for a tip. Seriously that’s alls they care about is a tip. €15 it was for a pack of crisp in that market !! I tried to go about my day in NYC but to be honest I could not deal with the price , the rudeness and overall chaotic environment of NYC after 24 hours I ended what was meant to be a four night stay I packed my suitcase and left and I’ll never to return not only to this hotel but the city. When I went down to the desk I informed the lady on reception I’d be leaving alls she was bothered about was if I was to make a complaint about cutting my holiday short then I’d go through the third party and not then ! No empathy or concern whatsoever! Even when I was leaving the luggage man was telling me not to move with my cases because he wanted to load them into the taxi. When he was out of sight I loaded them myself. There’s no way that hotel was having anymore money off me I’d lost enough.

What I received back was an email stating that they are going to investigate the situation and they don't know if they're going to give me a refund or not. Having clean room is a part of their policies. I really wish they would have investigated their rooms before letting me in.  Overall, the brand couldn't have been more insulting to a loyal customer. I'm a status member and I have over 100,000 points with the brand. It's sad that Hilton has went down so bad. Really what they should've done is just apologized and then sent me a refund. If I had been at a prestigious hotel  or a hotel for brand that cared, they would've sent me into a beautiful room with a bottle of wine. They would've gave me gift certificates to humble me and gave me a refund. Not here somehow they need to investigate. Investigate and clean the rooms before letting customers in that's what they should've done.",2024-11-14,New York City,NY,United States

106,Avoid at all costs. Random extra charges and rude staff,1,amenities,negative,"you pay this charge and then they give you $30 'credit' to use at the hotel, in their overpriced shop or overpriced bar.","I always thought of the Hilton as a high quality hotel, so this experience was quite a shock to the system.

It started badly when we turned up and the lobby looked like a building site, with chipboard walls and temporary fencing, threadbare carpets and scarily wobbly lifts.

Once we got up to the main reception it looked a lot nicer, as long as you don't count the reception woman, whose expression consistently suggested she thought we were the scum of the earth and that we were completely wasting her time turning up at the check in desk to, well, you know, check in.

This was when we discovered the 'Resort Charges'. Which basically means they are going to charge you an extra $30 per day for... absolutely nothing at all. We spent quite a lot of time asking her to explain exactly what this was, but she just kept repeating the same garbled, circular nonsense - which makes sense in a way, because it is at the end of the day a charge for nothing.

You pay this charge and then they give you $30 'credit' to use at the hotel, in their overpriced shop or overpriced bar. If you use slightly under $30 then you forfeit the rest. If you use anything over the $30 then you're paying them even more than you needed.

I know the States is already famous for being ruthlessly corporate and trying to squeeze every last cent out of a person, but it blows my mind that they can levy this compulsory charge and call it a 'resort charge' as if that explains anything at all. 

The room was fine, clean etc. Nothing special. The view was very nice - I will give it that.

My final complaint is that when we went to check out, we discovered that sour faced lady had charged our room upgrade at $200 per night, even though she had told us it was $100. Our shock was clearly palpable because the (much nicer) male receptionist who checked us out, reduced it back down. But it did give us the sense that the upgrade costs are made at the whim of the staff member and may vary depending on how much they like you. Who knows? Couldn't get a straight answer about that either.

And when we did finally get the bill it was more confusing then a cryptic crossword, with hundreds of tiny entries for variously obfuscated charges and taxes, making it basically impossible to work out if the amount was right, because you'd have to sit there for an hour with a professional accountant to make sense of it. I have no idea whether that is just part of the US's 'fascinating' tax system or whether it was unique to the Hilton, but it was certainly not welcome.

So no, I do not recommend staying at the Hilton New York Times Square,",2024-11-04,New York City,NY,United States

Location 2. Security 3. Cleanlihess 4. Price and 5. Amenities...but the Hilton New York Times Square checked them all - and then some! This was my first time staying at this location but it won't be my last. The location alone makes it a 10:10 in my book - it's within easy walking distance of SO many things - the subway is just outside the front entrance, my favorite restaurants are blocks away and Target is literally across the street! Running across to stock up on snacks, beverages and essentials that I left at home was super easy and convenient. 
    I was traveling solo for a work event, so security was also at the top of my list of needs. Upon arrival, was greeted by a team of hotel security who told me I'd need to take the elevator up several floors to reach the main lobby. I loved the fact that strangers can't wander into a ground-floor lobby. Upon arriving at the lobby, I was asked for ID by efficient check-in personnel. Getting to my floor by scanning my room card was another plus that I appreciated. Throughout my stay, I felt safe and secure with the knowledge that the hotel followed all security protocols. 
   As for the hotel room, I was pleasantly surprised to find one in which I could actually walk around! The room was spacious and well-appointed, equipped with modern conveniences and technology. The adjacent bathroom was spacious and spotlessly clean. This is not something I've experienced at all NYC hotels, even those with recognizable names. 
   Each day as I left the hotel, security officials o the ground floor were interested in where I was going (something that made me feel secure, knowing others kinew of my plans) and quick to offer suggestions on nearby restaurants and transportation. I simply can't say enough good things about hotel staff, especially the men working in this area. 
  Overall, the Hilton New York Times Square is simply the BEST place to stay in NYC if walking to ""almost everything"" is a priority, along with safety. I will be back in Jan. 2025 and most assuredly, I will be staying at my new favorite NYC hotel!",2024-10-20,New York City,NY,United States

119,AVERAGE HOTEL BUT GOOD LOCATION,3,cleanliness,positive,the rooms are very dated & not very clean.,"I was pretty disappointed when I first checked into the room. My expectation for Hilton hotels is high as the rooms are good when I stayed in other countries. 

It was an old hotel without much upgrading on its furnishing & the hotel building as it is located at a very prime & convenient location with many hotel guests staying here every day. I guess it is hard for the management to renovate the whole hotel building & replace new furnishings in the rooms. The rooms are very dated & not very clean. The hotel only provides towels. There are no amenities like toothbrush, toothpaste, disposable shower cap & shaver. There are also no cups in the toilet to put our toothbrush & toothpaste so I had to get the disposable cups in the pantry drawer to use for brushing my teeth. There is no bathroom slippers or bathrobes. The housekeeping also did not reset the safe box to ensure it can be used & I was unable to place some important items in the safe box. There was no USB outlet for charging phone so I had to use my travel adapter to plug in. 

There is no swimming pool in the hotel but they have a fitness / gym room which I never visit.

Luckily check in was fast for us as we arrived in the morning & not so crowded. The crowd will usually come in the afternoon & evening to check in & check out. We had to pay extra USD 20 per night to upgrade to an executive room at the higher floor as it was available during the morning & the room we booked in advance was only available for check in after 3pm. We were tired after flew in from Doha so we took up the offer.

The housekeeping is acceptable. The staffs generally are friendly & ok. 

But the location of the hotel is exceptionally good as it is walking distance to the subway & the port authority bus terminal where it is very convenient to buy the bus coach tickets to Woodbury Premium Outlet. Boarding & alighting at the same bus terminal makes our shopping very convenient. It is also near to all the theatres to watch plays & musicals. A lot of food places near the hotel.

123,Disappointing,2,amenities,negative,the elevator itself (only one) looked like something out of a tenement - it was surrounded by paper and tape - maybe they were working on it but it looked awful.,"Incredibly disappointed by this hotel. 
- first upon arrival, you have to take an elevator up to the lobby. It was hard to figure out the process, a bellman finally explained it. The elevator itself (only one) looked like something out of a tenement - it was surrounded by paper and tape - maybe they were working on it but it looked awful. Once in this elevator it was ridiculously dark - all black and I could barely make out the buttons - all this before I elven get to the lobby.

I was there one night for business and just wanted to get some room service and sleep, but THERE IS NO ROOM SERVICE. I was shocked by this and asked the person checking me in and she actually said they “had room service prior to the pander.” Yes, the same pandemic that has basically been an afterthought for 2 years, evidently still keeps Hilton from having room service. She said something about there being a QR code in the room to order from the market in the lobby, but once in the room I could not find the code. So I had to go down to the market to get a sandwich and side - all pre-cooked terrible stuff and way overpriced even for Manhattan. 

The room Itself was very basic. It was loud, which I did not expect as I’ve stayed at the Marriott Marquee Times Square and it was much better soundproofed. Worst part was the bed was too firm and uncomfortable. 

The funny thing is, I have 10 years Platinum or higher with Marriott Bonvoy and before this stay was considering changing loyalty programs to Hilton - no way will that happen after this experience.

I definitely do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2024-10-09,New York City,NY,United States

So I had to go down to the market to get a sandwich and side - all pre-cooked terrible stuff and way overpriced even for Manhattan. 

The room Itself was very basic. It was loud, which I did not expect as I’ve stayed at the Marriott Marquee Times Square and it was much better soundproofed. Worst part was the bed was too firm and uncomfortable. 

The funny thing is, I have 10 years Platinum or higher with Marriott Bonvoy and before this stay was considering changing loyalty programs to Hilton - no way will that happen after this experience.

I definitely do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",2024-10-09,New York City,NY,United States

- first upon arrival, you have to take an elevator up to the lobby. It was hard to figure out the process, a bellman finally explained it. The elevator itself (only one) looked like something out of a tenement - it was surrounded by paper and tape - maybe they were working on it but it looked awful. Once in this elevator it was ridiculously dark - all black and I could barely make out the buttons - all this before I elven get to the lobby.

133,Average,3,attractions,positive,hotel is in a good location to explore new york.,"Hotel is in a good location to explore New York.

Very close to Times Square.

On arrival, we were checked in quite quickly (although we had arrived at 7:30 so no rush), receptionist seemed quite helpful but soon got to the $35 (plus tax so around $40) charge that was compulsory per room, even though we were quite late arriving we were still charged for the first day. You were credited $35 a day to use in the hotel shop and bar..2 bottles of Budweiser and a coke was around $30 and crisps around $5 so didn’t go far and didn’t roll over to the next day …felt a bit of a rip off.

Seemed to be a tipping culture for everything. As you arrive they take your cases off you, I don’t think rolling a case on a trolley to a lift deserves a tip, when we were leaving noticed that to store a bag was $5 an item and seemed to want a tip on top - I guess I’m used to European hotels that provide this at no cost, even the self service shop wanted a tip?? Certainly don’t feel you should be pressurised…think this is an American thing though.

Our room was accessible for a wheelchair user, it included an accessible shower, the problem though was that shower seat was some distance from the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner provided, difficult to use.

The sink was not easy to use from a wheelchair.

Room was spacious enough, reasonable standard (hairdryer was old) and daily changes of towels/beds made, but nothing special.

Large TV but nothing much to watch on it.

Didn’t use the hotel for breakfast.

On check out day (11 am), our key cards weren’t effective after 9am, as we weren’t being picked up until 1pm checked out at 11am, receptionist quite rude about it.

New York, for us, was a one off, certainly wouldn’t go back here if it weren’t.",2024-09-09,New York City,NY,United States

150,NYC done right!!,5,service,positive,staff was friendly and personable.,"Prime Location. The views are outrageous! My family of 8 came for a birthday trip to the city. We really enjoyed the hotel. It was under construction at the time, which was soon to be completed. However, the way they accommodated among it all was great! Staff was friendly and personable. 

We especially enjoyed Chef Jason Routzahn!! He ensured we had an especially memorable birthday trip for my husband, and son. His exceptional ability to provide such warmth and through hospitality is world class!!! 

At this location we were central to so many things that were walkable, and the activities we were not close to the subway was close & easy to navigate.  It is memory making like this that will keep us coming back!",2024-07-25,New York City,NY,United States

154,Overpriced - extremely shabby,2,service,negative,"i don’t know what was worse: the dirty hotel rooms, the hostile staff or the unnecessary fees we were charged.","Staying at the Hilton Times Square has been a rollercoaster of an experience. From when I last stayed here in August 2014 to now (July 2024) I can say that this establishment has deteriorated. I don’t know what was worse: the dirty hotel rooms, the hostile staff or the unnecessary fees we were charged. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with a dusty hotel room with crisp wrappers from the previous habitants of the room still on the floor. The chairs were dusty and still had remanence of food. We complained instantly and were told that we couldn’t change rooms and that someone would come to the room to address our concerns, however nobody came. Despite this, the cleaning staff were very friendly and made our beds and changed our towels everyday. However, the cleanliness aspect of the hotel wasn’t there, as our room was hoovered once in 9 days and all of surfaces in the room (including the TV remote) was covered in a thick layer of dust that we ended up cleaning ourselves. 
The Hilton Times Square provide a $35.00 allowance each day to spend in their hotel food shop. However, the items are unrealistically marked up which is made worse by unclear pricing, forcing you to guess the prices of the items and paying more than the intended $35.00 or having to ask the staff for the price of each item (which is both annoying and made us feel like we’re inconveniencing them). We were also unaware that if this $35.00 wasn’t spent then you’ll get billed for this amount at the end of your stay. As one day we only spent $32.00 and were charged $3 at the end of our stay. 
To conclude, Hilton may blame these short falls on their new renovation, however this didn’t seem a problem to us as the only thing the renovation affected was the waiting time for the elevator from the lobby to ground floor. I’d like to reiterate that the cleaning staff were very nice and friendly and the location of the hotel is good in relation to attractions, however these are the only positive pieces of feedback I can relay.",2024-07-20,New York City,NY,United States

I felt safe coming and going from the hotel (some reviews said it was unsafe) as a first timer in NYC I think you just have to be aware of your surroundings when walking in Time's Square and goion the underground.

There is a charge for your luggage if you have a late flight,its not very much,the hotel will store your luggage for you,they were amazing as we had to pop back and put bits in our luggage,no problems at all.
Overall we will definitely stay at the Hilton Time's Square again,as our daughter will be moving to the city from the UK in 2025,lots of visits planned.

Looking forward to seeing the Hotel finished as there was construction going on when we stayed,but didn't bother or disturb our stay at all.

159,Overall Good Stay,4,service,positive,"you also don’t get daily housekeeping and for what we paid, that’s not good either.","We spent three days in NYC, and this is a convenient location if you want to be in Times Square and near the main tourist attractions and Broadway shows.  We also had to take the Amtrak train to our next city, and it was an easy 10–15-minute walk to the Penn Station area.  The main entrance on busier 42nd street is closed due to renovations, so you instead go in on 41st street, right next door to the theater showing Aladdin.  You must take an elevator up to the lobby (and then you go to your floor) and even though it is just a couple of levels, we (and others) spent more time waiting for that elevator, then the one to take to our room on the 38th floor.  I asked a staff member if there were stairs as it would have been faster, and he said he wished there were (if that is really true, isn’t that a fire issue?).

On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of our room.  We assumed everything would be cramped, but we did not feel that way and it included a mini-refrigerator and coffee maker.  One compliant is that the thermostat could not be set below 68 degrees, so we were slightly warm at night.

One racket is they tack on a daily $35 resort fee, but that includes food you can get at the convenience store they have.  I found out it starts on your check-in day, or if you don’t use it that day, they will allow it the day we checked out.  The selection is decent, but with the usual unreasonable prices like almost $10 for a simple muffin.  The biggest rip-off they had was that they were offering a breakfast buffet for $49 per person, and we looked and it was barely better than you would get at a Hampton Inn.  Unless you have money to burn, skip it and there is a breakfast place right down the block.  You also don’t get daily housekeeping and for what we paid, that’s not good either.  There is no pool, but the fitness center is way above average for a hotel and is open 24 hours.

Finally, while safety and security are definitely an issue in NYC, I never felt unsafe at the hotel.  However, as you walk in there is a sign that there is supposed to be a security check as for example, they will make sure you have a room key.  However, we came in and out numerous times, and at various times of day, and never once we saw a security guard (just the bellhop and typically they were joking around with another staff member), and we were never asked to show a key, or anybody else that was coming in or out.  So, there is nothing stopping unwelcome guests from coming in.",2024-07-03,New York City,NY,United States

You must take an elevator up to the lobby (and then you go to your floor) and even though it is just a couple of levels, we (and others) spent more time waiting for that elevator, then the one to take to our room on the 38th floor.  I asked a staff member if there were stairs as it would have been faster, and he said he wished there were (if that is really true, isn’t that a fire issue?).

On the plus side, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of our room.  We assumed everything would be cramped, but we did not feel that way and it included a mini-refrigerator and coffee maker.  One compliant is that the thermostat could not be set below 68 degrees, so we were slightly warm at night.

One racket is they tack on a daily $35 resort fee, but that includes food you can get at the convenience store they have.  I found out it starts on your check-in day, or if you don’t use it that day, they will allow it the day we checked out.  The selection is decent, but with the usual unreasonable prices like almost $10 for a simple muffin.  The biggest rip-off they had was that they were offering a breakfast buffet for $49 per person, and we looked and it was barely better than you would get at a Hampton Inn.  Unless you have money to burn, skip it and there is a breakfast place right down the block.  You also don’t get daily housekeeping and for what we paid, that’s not good either.  There is no pool, but the fitness center is way above average for a hotel and is open 24 hours.

Finally, while safety and security are definitely an issue in NYC, I never felt unsafe at the hotel.  However, as you walk in there is a sign that there is supposed to be a security check as for example, they will make sure you have a room key.  However, we came in and out numerous times, and at various times of day, and never once we saw a security guard (just the bellhop and typically they were joking around with another staff member), and we were never asked to show a key, or anybody else that was coming in or out.  So, there is nothing stopping unwelcome guests from coming in.",2024-07-03,New York City,NY,United States

166,Some Things To Be Aware Of.,4,attractions,positive,"now, this hotel is in a perfect location.","We stayed at The Hilton Time Square for three nights. Couple of things everyone should know if you haven't heard are this: 1. The hotel is going through some renovations. Currently, there is no lounges or bars to relax in. No area to wait to relax or wait on friends or family. The reservation desk is in a temporary location. 2. I tried to call the front desk, (having a problem with the in room safe) a couple of times, and they never answered. Had to go down there from the 26 floor and one of the guys that assisted with luggage help me solve the problem. 3. Look out for the Destination Charge. This was about $35.00 per day. 4. There are only two elevators from the reservation desk to the ground floor. When we were there, one was out of order. So be aware, long lines could be an issue when you want to leave the hotel.
         Now, this hotel is in a perfect location. Our room was very nice an updated and clean. The staff were all very friendly and courteous and generally wanted to assist you with any requests you may have. Now the question is, would we return to this hotel?

167,Overall pleasant experience,4,amenities,positive,being able to head right to your room after a long day of travel is amazing.,"My family and I were booked on a cruise out of Manhattan and decided to head to NYC a day before to enjoy the city. As a Hilton Honors member, I had some points, so I decided to book the Hilton New York Times Square for the night. In route to NYC, I received a messaged advising that our room was  available earlier than promised. I was able to check-in and access the room without a key through the Hilton app, which was a big plus. Being able to head right to your room after a long day of travel is amazing.  

We booked the king corner studio suite, which was prefect for myself, my husband and my two teenage sons. The suite was very spacious and had a decent view of the city. The king bed was very comfortable and my sons commented the same about the sofa couch they occupied. The room was clean, which is one of the most important aspects of any hotel stay. The one issue I had with the room is the lack of adequate washcloths and towels to number of people I confirmed with I booked the room. We had to call housekeeping for two additional sets and it took some time for them to arrive, and we received way more than what was requested. 

The only other amenity we utilized at the hotel was valet parking. As a guest of the hotel, you would think parking would be more affordable. I understand that every in NYC is expensive, but 95 bucks was a bit excessive. You're also asked to give the attendant at least an hour to retrieve your vehicle. Honestly the parking is just a layer of inconvenience that I would have avoided if I had properly thought it through. But overall, I was happy with my stay of the Hilton New York Times Square.",2024-06-21,New York City,NY,United States

Service - 

Hit or miss. Mostly a miss, especially with the front desk staff. They are not trained to be welcoming, polite, or friendly. I understand it is NYC and you should not expect NY’ers to be friendly or nice, but c’mon you work in hospitality! They were very transactional and had zero personality. There are four front desk workstations, but I never saw them occupied with four people. Not even during the 4:00 PM check-in time when there was a line wrapped around the corner. There were long waits at the front desk during peak times when they should have been fully staffed. 

We arrived early, so I knew we would not be able to check-in. The front desk agent pre-checked me in and told me to come back after 2:00 PM to get our room keys. I did as she asked, but our room was not ready. She coped an attitude and told me to come back after 4:00 PM stating that they do not have many rooms with two beds and that is when check-in begins. We only came back after 2:00 PM because she told us to! What is the point of doing pre-check in? Doesn’t that let the system know that a person is already here waiting for a room? The entire situation was frustrating. 

The housekeepers who you would see in the hallway were all very friendly.  

Room - 

No doubt the standard rooms are some of the largest in NYC. Our room was massive, spacious, and super clean. Great working AC. Great working mini-refrigerator. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great curtains that kept the sun out when sleeping in. Safe. Iron. Ironing Board. Conveniently placed electrical outlets. 

The bathroom had ample counter space for your toiletries. Tub with shower curtain. Great shower water pressure and temperature. Very large plastic trash can like one you would have in your kitchen at home. It was strange and oddly placed, but I did enjoy having a large trash can in the room. 

Phone in room did not work. Wall lamp next to one bed did not work. Housekeeping cleaned room, but never checked wall soap dispenser in shower, and we ran out of soap. 

Hotel Information -

Check-out time is confusing. The website says 11:00 AM, but the sign attached to the inside of the hotel room door says 12:00 PM. The front desk staff said that the sign in the room is wrong. Replace it then with accurate information! I was granted a late check-out until 1:00 PM since I am Diamond status. I was told anything after 1:00 PM would incur a charge. 

The hotel charges an additional mandatory daily fee of $35.00 per room, per night. But, then you get it back as a credit? So annoying and unnecessary. Because I am Diamond status and because there were two of us, our daily credit was $71.00 ($35.00 + $18.00 + 18.00). 

It is free to store your luggage on arrival, but it is $5.00 per bag to store your luggage at check-out. OUTRAGEOUS! I have never seen this at a hotel before. 

The hotel restaurant only serves breakfast. It is a buffet at a cost of $49.00 per person + tax + tip. OUTRAGEOUS! I travel the world and have never seen a standard Hilton property charge this much for a breakfast buffet. 

The market is also OUTRAGEOULSLY priced. It is unbelievable!

The lobby is on floor 21. The hotel rooms are on floors 22-44.

The hotel isn’t the safest. Anyone can come and go. The Security sign on the ground level states that they will check your room key before you enter.

We arrived early, so I knew we would not be able to check-in. The front desk agent pre-checked me in and told me to come back after 2:00 PM to get our room keys. I did as she asked, but our room was not ready. She coped an attitude and told me to come back after 4:00 PM stating that they do not have many rooms with two beds and that is when check-in begins. We only came back after 2:00 PM because she told us to! What is the point of doing pre-check in? Doesn’t that let the system know that a person is already here waiting for a room? The entire situation was frustrating. 

The housekeepers who you would see in the hallway were all very friendly.  

Room - 

No doubt the standard rooms are some of the largest in NYC. Our room was massive, spacious, and super clean. Great working AC. Great working mini-refrigerator. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great curtains that kept the sun out when sleeping in. Safe. Iron. Ironing Board. Conveniently placed electrical outlets. 

The bathroom had ample counter space for your toiletries. Tub with shower curtain. Great shower water pressure and temperature. Very large plastic trash can like one you would have in your kitchen at home. It was strange and oddly placed, but I did enjoy having a large trash can in the room. 

Phone in room did not work. Wall lamp next to one bed did not work. Housekeeping cleaned room, but never checked wall soap dispenser in shower, and we ran out of soap. 

Hotel Information -

The hotel has 478 rooms and 44 floors. 

Check-out time is confusing. The website says 11:00 AM, but the sign attached to the inside of the hotel room door says 12:00 PM. The front desk staff said that the sign in the room is wrong. Replace it then with accurate information! I was granted a late check-out until 1:00 PM since I am Diamond status. I was told anything after 1:00 PM would incur a charge. 

The hotel charges an additional mandatory daily fee of $35.00 per room, per night. But, then you get it back as a credit? So annoying and unnecessary. Because I am Diamond status and because there were two of us, our daily credit was $71.00 ($35.00 + $18.00 + 18.00). 

It is free to store your luggage on arrival, but it is $5.00 per bag to store your luggage at check-out. OUTRAGEOUS! I have never seen this at a hotel before. 

The hotel restaurant only serves breakfast. It is a buffet at a cost of $49.00 per person + tax + tip. OUTRAGEOUS! I travel the world and have never seen a standard Hilton property charge this much for a breakfast buffet. 

The market is also OUTRAGEOULSLY priced. It is unbelievable!

The lobby is on floor 21. The hotel rooms are on floors 22-44.

The hotel isn’t the safest. Anyone can come and go. The Security sign on the ground level states that they will check your room key before you enter. They never checked ours and I never saw them check others. The elevator has a room key swipe, but they do not work, so you simply press your floor number and proceed. 

The fitness center is open 24 hours and is located on floor 22.

Location - 

The hotel is currently going through a renovation. Pinnacle Restaurant & Bar is closed and the main entrance on 42nd Street is also closed. You need to enter the hotel at 233 West 41st Street.

The location is the most central in NYC and in the heart of the Theater District / Times Square. You are very close to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Garment District, Hell's Kitchen, Madison Square Garden, New York Penn Station, and all of the subway lines are near the hotel. If you want a convenient and central location, this hotel is it.",2024-06-17,New York City,NY,United States
169,Frustrating Experience!,2,amenities,positive,great shower water pressure and temperature.,"I stayed here with a friend for four nights. Our nightly rate with all taxes and fees was $321.16 per night. Tax is 14.76% per night and you are charged an additional $3.50 per room, per night. We were assigned room 3019. 

Service - 

Hit or miss. Mostly a miss, especially with the front desk staff. They are not trained to be welcoming, polite, or friendly. I understand it is NYC and you should not expect NY’ers to be friendly or nice, but c’mon you work in hospitality! They were very transactional and had zero personality.

To provide a truly exceptional experience, a hotel relies on its staff, and I cannot give enough kudos to them, many who proudly wear 20-year pins! All of my interactions with staff were great, but I need to recognize a few:  Executive Chef Jason, breakfast waitstaff Francisco, and General Manager Thom, who was very visible interacting with staff, visiting with guests and checking with construction workers. However, perhaps one important reason why people return to this hotel is George at the Front Desk, who can handle any situation and solve any problem.  He is patient, kind and unflappable; he welcomes the often-exhausted traveler, Diamond Member or first-time Hilton guest alike.   
Another feature that appeals to me as a woman traveling alone is that the lobby is not on the street level; it is accessed by one of two elevators only.  And, to get to the elevators, you have to pass by two “pit bull” guys who won’t let anyone who doesn’t belong past them.

However, perhaps one important reason why people return to this hotel is George at the Front Desk, who can handle any situation and solve any problem.  He is patient, kind and unflappable; he welcomes the often-exhausted traveler, Diamond Member or first-time Hilton guest alike.   
Another feature that appeals to me as a woman traveling alone is that the lobby is not on the street level; it is accessed by one of two elevators only.  And, to get to the elevators, you have to pass by two “pit bull” guys who won’t let anyone who doesn’t belong past them.  Once these guys recognize you, they are friendly and welcome you back every time you walk back into the hotel.  The added level of security is appreciated!",2024-06-03,New York City,NY,United States

176,The best location for Times Square,4,cleanliness,positive,hotel is clean and inviting.,"I honestly don’t think there is a single hotel in a better location if you want to stay in Times Square. There is so much around you. In fact is was quite overwhelming as someone who is from wales. But if Times Square is what you want, then look no further. 

Hotel is clean and inviting. Staff on the door all day and night. 
Check in is strange but I think this might be a temporary thing as they have work going on. It’s on like the 20th floor. 
There’s a shop where you can spend your credit but of course that shop it hugely inflated on prices. 

Breakfast is $49 which is pretty crazy. Get breakfast outside. I was happy with my stay but got to deduct a star because of the prices on food and drinks.",2024-06-02,New York City,NY,United States

One night we didn’t have enough towels, and I could not get anyone to pick up at the front desk. I went downstairs and there were about 20 people in line checking in. I asked the person at the market if they could help me and they said they could not. I ended up going back upstairs and coming back downstairs again and finally was able to get more towels.

185,Avoid This Hilton At All Costs - Service/Food/People - Terrible Marks Across The Board.,1,service,negative,day manager was incredibly rude.,"What was imagined as a wonderful Mothers Day weekend to NYC turned into the worst possible Hotel experience ever.  This Hilton should be avoided at all costs. Let me run down just a few of experiences that were dealt with on a 3 night stay. 

1. Hilton reservation systems booked two identical rooms at the exact same date, exact same time.  Never told upon arrival.  Here is how I found out.  An order was submitted prior to my arrival to have a bottle of Champage and Strawberries to the room.   Apparently,  the pre-order triggered an auto-check in of the room (2nd incorrect room) and my initial reservation credit card used was billed.  Long story short on this bullet.  It took my to ask on the following morning about no champagne delivery that I was told it was delivered but to the wrong room.  That's when I found out about a duplicate room portfolio.

2. Untrained and uncaring individuals.  Day Manager was incredibly rude.  No apologies, no empathy, nothing.  He even said ""YOU must have double booked, this hotel must not be for YOU, maybe YOU should check out another hotel for your stay.  I am not exaggerating here.  Pretty much exactly what was said.

3. Food quality and uncaring individuals:  Visited restaurant for breakfast and immediately felt sick. Went to bring it to their attention. Not to get any refund or free meal but to let them know.  Once again, no empathy.  Just, ""how do we know you got sick here at our hotel?""  

4. Another order was attempted for Champagne to be delivered.  Again, employees just not caring about their jobs or the guest experience.  Here is what I was told:
Employee A.  We don't have room service at our hotel.   When I explained that they delivered champagne to the incorrect room last night, I was told, ""you'll need to pick that up at our market downstairs, we don't do room service"".   I asked for a manager. The manager (Employee B) said we don't deliver to rooms after 1 PM and we don't have strawberries for delivery which was odd, cause supposessively, I paid for Champagne and Strawberries the night before.  Again told, you will need to come down to the Market and get it yourself.

5. Overall service and attentiveness.  Be prepared to be treated like no one really cares about you because it clearly shows they don't give a s___ about their jobs. I was only able to speak to 1 person (a night manager) who honestly treated me like a human being, apologized for the experience, and provided me with the name of the General Manager.  When I spoke with the team in the morning and provide my phone for Thomas (GM) to call me, nothing happened.  I doubt very highly they even gave Thomas my number.  

6. The nail on the coffin.  Finally, checkout time.  Wanted to have hotel hold my bags for a bit while I grab some lunch as no late checkout was approved and was told to leave by 11, I was charged for each luggage piece being held.  

Final words.  STAY AWAY.  I don't know why I even chose Hilton.  I am both a Marriott Rewards and Hilton Rewards member but today, Hilton made it abundantly clear, I don't matter.  As of today, I will be deleting my membership from Hilton and never staying at another Hilton property.  There are way too many choices to stay when traveling.  Do yourself a favor, even if you are a loyal Hilton rewards member, stay away from this one.  Terribly managed top-down.",2024-05-13,New York City,NY,United States

187,We’ll be choosing a different place to stay next time.,2,service,positive,"friendlier service would be nice, too!","Our experience at the Hilton began with a check-in process that seemed to extend a bit longer than expected, taking approximately 15-20 minutes per party. This initial step could benefit from a streamlined approach to enhance guest satisfaction. Friendlier service would be nice, too!

Navigating to our room was an adventure in itself, involving a journey through two separate elevators and a brief walk. This unique layout added a distinctive touch to the hotel’s character, though most may find it less convenient.

We noticed that the hotel is undergoing renovations, evident by the construction activities in the lobby and entrance area. Halfway through our stay, the main entrance was relocated to a side street, which was a bit unexpected and led to an encounter with some colorful local characters. This move was unannounced. 

Inquiring about the hotel’s shuttle service to the airport presented us with a stern lecture of the process which was delivered with unexpected fervor. If you ask something similar, you may end up regretting it!

The room’s cleanliness was generally up to standard, although the shower curtain carried a peculiar scent that suggested it could use a refresh. Additionally, the absence of a microwave in the room meant that enjoying leftovers from the city’s culinary offerings would require a different plan.

Choosing the Hilton was a decision influenced by its reputable brand name. However, our stay did not entirely meet the high expectations we had set, based on previous experiences with the brand.

In short, we’ll be taking our business elsewhere the next time we visit NYC.",2024-05-12,New York City,NY,United States
188,Worst Hotel in Times Square,1,service,negative,the two front desk people were rude and refused to help me solve this problem.,"I have never experienced a hotel like this before. They were rude, unhelpful and unaccommodating all while being under heavy construction. I stayed at this hotel for a business conference that was happening in Times Square. I arrived to the hotel around 12pm and to check in early it would have been a $100 fee if it was before 4pm. They had no waiting area as they are currently under heavy construction. Once checked into my room, the bathtub was clogged and there was loads of hair everywhere. To have an early check in fee and rooms that are not up to standard is laughable. Their breakfast comes at a whopping $50 which is outlandish for your standard run of the mill hotel breakfast. You can find something cheaper and tastier out on the street which is what I did. The checkout process was my last straw. My company paid for this trip and used the company card when booking. At checkout they demanded a physical card and refused to work with me or my company on processing the bill virtually through a link, which they were able to do if wanted to. The two front desk people were rude and refused to help me solve this problem. After meeting with the manager, I thought the issue was fixed as they said to send an email and they will provide the link. Later in the day I found out that they charged my personal card the total cost ($1100) which was put down for incidentals when checking in. When attempting to call Vivianna Luigi the Director of Front Office for the hotel we found out the number on her card is disconnected. We attempted to call the hotel itself and could not get through, on the multiple attempts. When then called the building and they could not even get through to the hotel front desk. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I recommend you look elsewhere when staying in Times Square. This was an awful hotel experience all around. Additionally, for being a Hilton Honors member I expected more. If I could give zero stars, I would.",2024-05-11,New York City,NY,United States

We kind of managed to use up the $35 each day mostly - but its a bit tricky when the shop doesnt have any prices on around 90% of the items, so you just pick stuff up and hope it comes to around $35.  We more or less got a handle on this by the last day, but in previous days we had been under/over. Bar was quite pricey in comparison to others, $12 for a small beer, most other hotel bars gave a bigger beer or cheaper beer. However we were using up our $35 tax for the day. I would have preferred not to have this silly bother, but where the hotel stay was reasonably priced - I wasnt overly concerned - but it was a negative point of the stay. Check in was 4PM (!?!?!) really??? and they wanted $50 to check in an hour early - another little stealth tax. There was ongoing construction work, taking out one of the lifts from the lobby, and 2 up to the rooms for a couple of days - this caused some bottlenecks with getting in and  out -  but nothing too serious. The hotel overall was a little lack lustre - it was OK, but nothing special. The entrance lobby feels more like a tradesmans entrance, didnt really give the right vibe, and there were ongoing building works here too. Potentially when its all finished it might be nicer? Who knows..... Most of the staff were genuinely friendly, and the location was amazing, right where we wanted to be, and the view from our room on one of the upper floors was great. Bathroom looked a bit like it was from the 1980s, but it was functional. Taps for the sinks designed specially so that if you try to use them to wash your hands all the water splashes onto the worktop as the taps are quite short and mounted so the end just reaches the sink. Air con? I think it was air con? maybe just a noisy fan - Im not sure - there were some controls on the wall which allowed you to turn something noisy on which possibly cooled the room a little, but couldn't set the temperature below 20 degrees- so ended up being quite hot most nights. Room equipped with iron and ironing board - ended up being handy for us. There is a coffee machine, but no kettle - so if you want to bring tea with you and make that you just have to use the coffee machine to make hot water. Bed was spacious (I think we had a queen) - but a touch hard, although the pillows were quite nice. At checkout, they just wanted to email me the final bill for resort taxes without me seeing it - who agrees to a bill without seeing it? I insisted on a copy so I could check it before accepting it - I guess they are just used to people waving money in their direction without a  care. Would I recommend this hotel, probably not - during our stay in New York we visited many other hotels/rooftop bars and virtually all were much nicer than the Hilton in Times Square, so if I ever went back I would choose a different hotel, and happily pay a tiny bit more if necessary.

At checkout, they just wanted to email me the final bill for resort taxes without me seeing it - who agrees to a bill without seeing it? I insisted on a copy so I could check it before accepting it - I guess they are just used to people waving money in their direction without a  care. Would I recommend this hotel, probably not - during our stay in New York we visited many other hotels/rooftop bars and virtually all were much nicer than the Hilton in Times Square, so if I ever went back I would choose a different hotel, and happily pay a tiny bit more if necessary.

194,"Pretty average really, good location, good views, thats where the good points end.",3,amenities,negative,"maybe just a noisy fan - im not sure - there were some controls on the wall which allowed you to turn something noisy on which possibly cooled the room a little, but couldn't set the temperature below 20 degrees- so ended up being quite hot most nights.","Mixed feelings, we got a reasonable price on the hotel booking - so I factored in the $35 per day 'tax' that they extort from you by forcing you to buy overpriced snacks from their mini-market which has virtually zero choice. We kind of managed to use up the $35 each day mostly - but its a bit tricky when the shop doesnt have any prices on around 90% of the items, so you just pick stuff up and hope it comes to around $35.  We more or less got a handle on this by the last day, but in previous days we had been under/over. Bar was quite pricey in comparison to others, $12 for a small beer, most other hotel bars gave a bigger beer or cheaper beer. However we were using up our $35 tax for the day. I would have preferred not to have this silly bother, but where the hotel stay was reasonably priced - I wasnt overly concerned - but it was a negative point of the stay. Check in was 4PM (!?!?!) really??? and they wanted $50 to check in an hour early - another little stealth tax. There was ongoing construction work, taking out one of the lifts from the lobby, and 2 up to the rooms for a couple of days - this caused some bottlenecks with getting in and  out -  but nothing too serious. The hotel overall was a little lack lustre - it was OK, but nothing special. The entrance lobby feels more like a tradesmans entrance, didnt really give the right vibe, and there were ongoing building works here too. Potentially when its all finished it might be nicer? Who knows..... Most of the staff were genuinely friendly, and the location was amazing, right where we wanted to be, and the view from our room on one of the upper floors was great. Bathroom looked a bit like it was from the 1980s, but it was functional. Taps for the sinks designed specially so that if you try to use them to wash your hands all the water splashes onto the worktop as the taps are quite short and mounted so the end just reaches the sink. Air con? I think it was air con? maybe just a noisy fan - Im not sure - there were some controls on the wall which allowed you to turn something noisy on which possibly cooled the room a little, but couldn't set the temperature below 20 degrees- so ended up being quite hot most nights. Room equipped with iron and ironing board - ended up being handy for us.

The room was lovely modern and very clean.We had a great view. They take a charge of $30 each day but this changed into credit which you can use in the shop and bar. Great for breakfast with choices of cereal, breakfast bap and coffee. Use it or lose it ! They charge $5 to store each piece of luggage which people should be aware of. This hotel is right near the metro at Times Square and in the middle of everything. I would stay here again.",2024-04-27,New York City,NY,United States
